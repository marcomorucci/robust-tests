Load the following files in AMPL: covariates.dat, fracture.dat, outcome.dat, fracture.mod,fracture.run
Run the fracture.run file from AMPL. 
	It will generate two files: glow_max.txt (including maximum value of z) and glow_min.txt (including minimum value of z);
		
Using an excel spreadsheet, calculate P_min from Z_max and P_max from Z_min (see the attached excel sheet)
