*R packages required to run the code:* 
- reshape2, ggplot2, ggjoy, latex2exp, plyr

*Python packages required to run the code:*
- numpy, scipy, pandas (for Figures 2 and 10)
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, tabulate (for Figure 9)

To reproduce results in Figures 2 and 10 (appendix) run: simulations/simulate_and_plot.R

To reproduce results in Figure 9 (appendix) run: distribution_comparison.py
